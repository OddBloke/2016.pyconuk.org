Blanc is an ethical Django-powered digital studio, that helps NGOs solve tricky
problems around the world, clients include Oxfam International, Civicus,
Amnesty International, Greenpeace & Macmillan Cancer Support. We love PyCon UK
(and have far too much fun producing some of the artwork) and can’t wait to
hang out with you all. We’re on the look-out for people to join our team, so do
say hello.
