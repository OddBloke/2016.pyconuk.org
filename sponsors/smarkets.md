Smarkets is Python and Erlang technology company based in central
London.  We've built one of the world's largest betting exchanges,
also known as a prediction market, with significantly better odds than
the competition. Our strength is technology and trading with a passion
to push the known boundaries of real-time financial technology.  We're
a growing team of 68, boasting 22 nationalities, and our platform has
handled over Â£3 billion of bets since launching in 2010, allowing us
to become one of the most profitable companies per employee in Europe.
Our mission is to disrupt one of the oldest industries in the world by
rethinking the method and model of the betting business. We think
traditional sports betting takes advantage of bettors, taking up to a
15% margin on bets. We offer the industry's lowest margin of around
1%. We can and will do better.

We're building a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent system
capable of scaling to thousands of executions per second with
sub-millisecond latency. Whether we are working on the exchange
platform, the front-end or trading mechanisms, we love solving real
and challenging problems - from pushing Python performance to new
heights to handling real-time design constraints. The Smarkets
platform is written predominantly on Python and Erlang, and relies
heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. We use REST where we
can. We deploy to production several times a day.  Smarkets prides
itself on collecting individuals seeking challenge, and our team
members' experiences show this in our former financial and adtech
engineers, researchers, scientists, and PhDs all working at one of the
most dynamic workplaces in Europe!
