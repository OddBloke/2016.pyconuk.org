A Python Powerhouse, STX Next is Europe's biggest and (probably) best Python software house.

What make us soooooh good?

We not only write clean code but also keep in mind our clients' business goals - in the end, that makes the difference. With plenty of experienced people on board, we are always able to find the best solution to any problem - technical or business related.

Customer focused teams working on one project in one room. We don’t get distracted by splitting time between clients and that’s how we stay super engaged.

We find communication and cost control crucial to efficient cooperation. That’s why we implemented  a time/cost management tool - because you need to be in control.

We don’t want to brag, but well.. with over 10 years on the market, more than 200 successfully delivered Python-based projects and over 130 developers, STX Next is the true Python Powerhouse.
