The Government Digital Service (GDS) is part of the Cabinet Office. Our job is to work with departments to transform government. 

GDS was established in response to Martha Lane Fox’s report, ‘Directgov 2010 and beyond: revolution not evolution’.

Our responsibilities include:

 * running GOV.UK, the best place to find government services and information 
 * working with the rest of government to make public services simpler and better 
 * building platforms like GOV.UK Verify – a way to confirm users are who they say they are 
 * working to ensure government data is good data, more usable for all 
 * helping departments make better-informed decisions when they need to buy technology 
 * helping departments provide their staff with better value technology that's more of a tool and less of a barrier 

We always start with user needs. We are agile. We work to a set of Design Principles that guide us in everything we do. We believe in working openly, because making things open makes them better. 

We are recognised world leaders in public sector digital innovation. The GOV.UK website is an internationally-recognised digital platform for public services. It won the Design of The Year award in 2013.
