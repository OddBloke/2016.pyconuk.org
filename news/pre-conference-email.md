This is an email that we are sending to all delegates before the conference.

With the conference just around the corner, we want to share a few practicalities with you.


## Venue

The [Open Day](http://2016.pyconuk.org/open-day/) on Thursday will be held in the [Bute Building](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/estat/accessibilityinformation/cathayscampus/butebuilding/buteaccess.html) at Cardiff University.  Entrance is free and open to everyone, but you'll a ticket for the Open Day, even if you've already got a ticket for the main conferencee.

The rest of the conference will be held at [Cardiff City Hall](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/find-us).

Both venues are accessible for people of limited mobility. If you need to park near the venue because of mobility issues, please contact us and we'll do our best to help.


## Timetable

The registration desk opens each day at 8am.  We'd encourage you to turn up as early as you can to avoid the rush at 8.55!

Each day's programme starts at 9am.  The Open Day finishes at 4pm, while other days finish at 6.15pm.

You can find the full schedule on the [conference website](http://2016.pyconuk.org/programme/).


## Evening dinners

We're hosting the conference dinner at City Hall on the evening of Friday 16th.  The dinner is always a highlight of the conference.  Tickets cost £30, and are [available here](http://2016.pyconuk.org/conference-dinner/).

On the other evenings, we've booked the restaurant at [the Clink](http://theclinkcharity.org/the-clink-restaurants/cardiff-wales/), and you're invited to join us.  Again, tickets cost £30 and are [available on the website](http://2016.pyconuk.org/the-clink/).


## Disruption on the trains

The [Severn Tunnel will be closed](https://www.gwr.com/travel-updates/planned-engineering/severn-tunnel) for the duration of the conference, so if you're planning to come by train from London, you'll need to expect a slightly tedious journey!


## Code of Conduct

In common with all Python conferences, the conference has a [Code of Conduct](http://2016.pyconuk.org/code-of-conduct/), to which all delegates are expected to conform.  Please make yourself familiar with it.


## Conference Slack team

We are experimenting with setting up a [Slack](https://slack.com/) team for the duration of the conference.  You should receive an email invitation to join the team in the next day or two.


## Workshops

Some workshops have setup required.  Please check the session descriptions in advance, so that workshops can start promptly.


## Conference WiFi

We hope that the WiFi at the venue is up to supporting the number of people at the conference.  However, we can't guarantee it, so please try to avoid hogging bandwidth, and if you can, try to bring a device that you can tether from.


## Volunteering

Would you like to help out at the conference?  We're looking for people to staff the information desk during the morning, and for people to chair sessions.  If you'd like to help, please [get in touch](http://2016.pyconuk.org/contact/).

The [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/pyconuk2016/) workshop on Thursday is also looking for a couple more coaches.  More information about this is on the [Django Girls website](https://djangogirls.org/pyconuk2016/#coach).


## Children's Day

There are still some tickets left for our [children's day](http://2016.pyconuk.org/children/).  Why not bring your kids along on Saturday for a fun-packed day of activities and workshops where they can learn all about getting the most out of the world with Python?  Tickets cost just £5.


## Sponsors

Finally, we'd like to thank all our sponsors for their support.  Without them, we wouldn't be able to put on the conference.  They'll be exhibiting during the conference, so please go and say hello.


See you in Cardiff!
