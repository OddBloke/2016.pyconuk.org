title: Help build a supercomputer in a briefcase

Join [Russel Winder](https://www.russel.org.uk/stories/short-biography.html)'s project at PyCon UK 2016 to develop a
new open-source supercomputer, based on Raspberry Pis in clusters.

The project has a number of aims. One is to come up with a design that others can easily adopt and work with, so it's not a
one-off project but something that will have enduring benefit.

Another is to give people a practical hands-on introduction to working in friendly company with the techniques involved.

Finally (this is Russel's *hidden agenda* , so don't tell anyone) the project aims to create something that can be used
in schools to introduce parallelism and concurrency.

Much of the work will cover the software required to set up ad-hoc clusters, but there will be some hardware issues
to tackle too.

Russel will introduce the project in a talk on our [open day](/introduction/), and hold a planning and introduction
session that day. On [Monday](/code-day/) work on the project will begin in earnest during the sprints.

**Everyone's welcome**. You don't need to be an expert or an advanced programmer to join in. It's meant to be a fun
project and an opportunity to learn. However, if you have an *actual briefcase* and some skills that would help make
the finished project look impressive, you'll be especially warmly welcomed...

You can just turn up and join in, but you can also [contact Russel](https://www.russel.org.uk/stories/contact.html) if
you'd like to help plan the project.

Don't forget to bring your Raspberry Pis with you.

### Do you have an idea for an activity at PyCon UK?

Our [Call for proposals](/cfp/) will be closing soon - on the 28th June.
