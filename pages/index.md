PyCon UK is the annual gathering of the UK Python community and its friends
from around the world. This year, the conference is in Cardiff, from Thursday
15th to Monday 19th September.

* Open Day venue (*Thursday*): Cardiff University Bute Building
* Main venue (*Friday to Monday*): [Cardiff City Hall](http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/)

## Overview of the programme

* **Thursday**: [Open Day, with introductory workshops, talks and more](/open-day/)
* **Friday to Sunday**: [a packed programme of talks and other sessions](/programme/)
* **Monday**: [sprints](/what-are-sprints/) and more [advanced workshops](/programme/#monday)

We'll be putting on a programme of talks, workshops, and other events aimed at
the whole Python community, from web developers to hardware engineers, from
professionals to hobbyists.  There will be an [education programme](/teachers/)
for teachers, and an [expanded research programme](/research/) aimed at
researchers from the humanities, arts and scientists.  The [children's
day](/children/) returns too.

## Diversity, accessibility, inclusion

We want this to be the best PyCon UK ever, and a key part of that is our commitment to [diversity, accessibility and
inclusion](/diversity-accessibility-inclusion/).

## Tickets

Through the generosity of our sponsors, we're able to make the conference more
affordable than in recent years, with individual [tickets](/tickets/) only £96.
For the first time, we're also offering a [Financial Aid
Programme](/financial-aid/).

## Sponsorship

PyCon UK cannot happen without sponsors.  If you or your company are interested
in supporting the conference — perhaps you're recruiting, or sell to
developers, or want to give something back to the community — take a look at
our [sponsorship options](/sponsorship/).

## Code of Conduct

We're committed to ensuring the conference is welcoming, enjoyable, and safe
for everyone, and so we expect all attendees to agree to our [Code of
Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).
