# Slack
This year we're experimenting with a conference Slack, for conference delegates to communicate with each other and with the organisers during the conference.

All delegates should receive an email invitation to join the team. Get in touch if you think you should have received one but haven't.

We plan to close the team on November 19th, two months after the end of the conference.

We've deliberately restricted the creations of new channels but we're happy to create some upon request so feel free to get in touch if you have an idea for a channel that you think would be useful.


## Rules for our Slack channel
As with any of our conference spaces (online or physical), participants are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

In order to make the experience pleasant for everyone, we also ask that you follow some Slack-specific rules:

2. Try to keep on-topic in each channel, and only post job posting to the #jobs channel.
1. Do not mention people who don't belong to a particular room in that room.
3. Do not edit a channel's topic without the organizers' approval.
4. Be respectful of people's time in DMs.

If at any time you're feeling uncomfortable due to anyone's behaviour on the Slack channel, please [contact the organisers](http://2016.pyconuk.org/code-of-conduct/reporting-harassment/), approaching them at the conference, or using the emergency phone numbers listed in the Code of Conduct.

When possible, include screenshots or chat logs of any unwanted messages.
