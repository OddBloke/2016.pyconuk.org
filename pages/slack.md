# Rules for our Slack channel
As with any of our conference spaces (online or physical), participants are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

In order to make the experience pleasant for everyone, we also ask that you follow some slack-specific rules:

1. Do not message people privately without their consent, and do not invite them to join any room without their consent.
2. Do not mention people who don't belong to particular room in that room.
3. Do not post advertising or job postings outside of the dedicated #jobs channel.
4. Do not edit a channel's topic without the organizers' approval.
5. We've deliberately restricted the creations on new channels but we're happy to create some upon request so feel free to get in touch if you have an idea for a channel that you think would be useful.

If at any time you're feeling uncomfortable due to anyone's behaviour on the Slack channel, please [contact the organisers](http://2016.pyconuk.org/code-of-conduct/reporting-harassment/), approaching them at the conference, or using the emergency phone numbers listed in the Code of Conduct.

When possible, include screenshots or chat logs of any unwanted messages.
