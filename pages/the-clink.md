# Dinner at the Clink

On Thursday 15th, Saturday 17th, and Sunday 18th, we have booked [the
Clink](http://theclinkcharity.org/the-clink-restaurants/cardiff-wales/), Her
Majesty's Prison Cardiff, Knox Road, Cardiff, CF24 0UG.

The Clink is one of the best places to eat in Cardiff. The food is delicious, made from the best locally-grown produce, and prepared imaginatively; it has won numerous awards. Don’t miss it.

The Clink is special for another reason. It’s at Cardiff Prison, and trains and employs serving prisoners, who work in the kitchen and in the restaurant.

About 49% of UK prisoners re-offend within a year of leaving prison. The Clink aims to break the cycles responsible for this, by providing prisoners with skills, qualifications and prospects, and helping them find secure full-time employment in the hospitality sector upon their release.

As well as awards for its food, The Clink has won several for its educational work and its success in the rehabilitation of prisoners.

Note that alcohol is not served, but we’ll take you to a Cardiff pub for a drink afterwards.

**Please arrive at 18.45.** The restaurant is booked for 7.00pm each evening, but you should aim to arrive at 6.45pm.  Tickets are £30 for a three-course dinner that includes an introductory non-alcoholic cocktail and tea/coffee afterwards.

We expect these tickets to sell out completely on each night. We have booked
the entire restaurant up to its full capacity and we will not be able to
squeeze more people in - buy your tickets sooner rather than later to avoid
disappointment.
