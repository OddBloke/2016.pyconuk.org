Alex is a software engineer at [Metaswitch Networks](http://www.metaswitch.com), writing code for the telecoms industry.
Among other things, he has worked on [Project Calico](https://www.projectcalico.org/), a pure-Python networking layer for OpenStack and Docker.
When he’s not programming at work, he relaxes by coming home to do more programming – mostly Python, occasionally bits of open-source.

Programming aside, Alex enjoys studying World War II cryptography, origami, and cooking.
