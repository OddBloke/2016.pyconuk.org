Iâ€™m currently an undergrad studying Mathematics at Cardiff University. I first started coding two years ago, learning HTML, CSS and Python on the internet. In my first year at Cardiff, I have gone on to learn the basics of Python, Django and JavaScript, for both academic work and personal projects.
