maintains both the Skyfield library for amateur astronomers as well as its
predecessor PyEphem. He is the author of Foundations of Python Network
Programming, is an architect of the Django-powered “Go Botany” site, and tries
to share everything he learns with the community that has given him such a
great programming language for free.
